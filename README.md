## Overview

UrbanPulse is a smart city platform designed to keep residents informed about their surroundings. It provides real-time information on traffic incidents, weather updates, local services, and community news, all in one place. With an interactive map and user-friendly interface, UrbanPulse empowers residents to stay connected and engaged with their city.

## Why UrbanPulse?
Cities are becoming increasingly complex, and while the world is more connected than ever, the need for local, real-time information has never been greater. Residents want to stay informed, but traditional methods of communication often fail to provide timely and relevant updates. UrbanPulse solves this problem by giving residents access to a platform that offers everything they need to stay connected to their city in real time.

By putting important local informationâ€”such as traffic incidents, weather updates, and community newsâ€”into the hands of every resident, UrbanPulse encourages active participation in the community. The platform isn't just about receiving information, it's about enabling residents to contribute, stay informed, and help build a smarter, safer, and more connected city.

## Why Use UrbanPulse?

UrbanPulse simplifies how people interact with their environment:
- Stay informed about local incidents and hazards.
- Discover nearby services and community updates.
- Contribute to public safety by reporting issues.
- Access location-specific weather and air quality info.
- Engage with neighbors through a social feed.

This platform promotes transparency, safety, and community involvement, making it an essential tool for smart city living.
